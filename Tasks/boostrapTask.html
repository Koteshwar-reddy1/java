      <center><h1>East Godavari</h1></center>
      <p>
        East Godavari District which is the largest and the most populous
        district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, was successively ruled by
        Mauryas, Sathavahanas, Vishnu Kundins, Eastern Chalukyas, Cholas,
        Kaktiyas, Musunuri Chieftians, Kondaveeti Reddy Kings, Gajapathis,
        Kutubshahis and then by the British. It was under the Raj, on April 15,
        1925, East Godavari District was formed as per G.O.No.502. East Godavari
        is the richest district of the state, in terms of GDP, is both the
        cultural and tourist hub of the state.
      </p>
  <center><h1>Godavari River</h1></center>
      <p>
        River Godavari starts as a trickle at Nasik in Maharashtra. If
        flows through the States of Marashtra and Andhra Pradesh Pradesh and
        becomes mighty and majestic at Rajahmundry. It is the largest river in
        South India. Godavari, with its several Tributaries, occupies 1/10th of
        the country. Its total length is 1450KMs. In Andhra Pradesh, it flows to
        an extent of 927 kms. RJY3 Legend has it that the seven sages Gowthama,
        Vasista, Atri, Viswamitra, Kowsika. Bharadwaja and Agasthya (known as
        Saptha Maharushulu), each tributary is named after the sage whobrought
        it. At present, Gowthami and Vasista alone are visible. At Rajahmundry
        is 4 kms wide and at Dowleswaram it is 7 kms wide. River Godavari
        inspired Adikavi Nannayya (First poet in Telugu Language ) to undertake
        translation of Vyasa Mahabharata into Telugu from the Sanskrit original.
        It was not a mere translation. It was transcreation Nannayya very wisely
        borrowed the storyline and the ideas from the original and wrote in his
        own idiomatic way. But unfortunately he died after finishing 21/2 cantos
        (parvas), Yerrapragada completed the remaining parva closely following
        parvas in his won imitable style. This poetic trinity is held in high
        esteem by later poets. Scholar poet Srinadha also lived for many years
        at Rajahmundry. The very sight of river Godavari makes one poetical and
        lyrical. Many imaginative directors like Bapu captured the beauty of
        Godavari on the celluloid. A boat ride on the Godavari on a cool
        tranquil moonlit night is a thrilling and everlasting experience.
