      <h2>Project:</h2>
      <h4>Title: &nbsp;Generation of Power Using Railway Track</h4>
      <p>
        Developed an innovative system to harness kinetic energy from moving
        trains using a rack and pinion mechanism. The project involved designing
        and implementing a prototype that converts the linear motion of trains
        into rotational energy, which is then transformed into electrical power.
        This sustainable solution aims to utilize the otherwise wasted energy
        from train movements, contributing to renewable energy sources and
        enhancing energy efficiency in railway operations.
